        <p class="text-light"> Hello everyone! My name is Sergio Perez and I am a student enrolled in Coding Boot Camp at
          Northwestern. When I am not practicing my coding skills you can catch me at my job at Northshore Evanston
          Hospital. There I work as a Patient Transporter, basically if
          a patient needs to go to a test site, I am the one they call.
          I enjoy taking pictures of my girlfriends dog Nikki, as well as pictures landscapes with my little sister. I
          also love watching Game of Thrones, I am currently on season 6, so no spoilers please.
          My favorite food is my mom's homemade Mexican food and my favorite drink is water.
          My favorite place to visit, besides Mexico, is Sedona, Arizona. It reminds me of my parentsâ€™ hometown.

        <p class="text-light"> When I am not at work or class I like to spend time with my family and loved ones. Some
          other things that I like to do are traveling, hiking, playing video games, going
          swimming and hiking. Many people have always said that I come off as shy at first but that is just me getting
          comfortable to the people around me. Once I do I go all out me showing my good sence of humor and very talkative
          person that I am.
